# Production Readiness Report – MCP Server Project

**Date**: 2025-08-23  
**Overall**: **8.5 / 10** – Strong foundation; a few targeted follow-ups remain

---

## ✅ Strengths

### Security
- Sandboxed filesystem (path traversal safeguards)
- Auth: JWT (preferred) or local; RBAC scaffolding
- **Audit logging (new API)** with structured context
- **Security headers** (incl. HSTS), CORS
- Non-root container

### Reliability & Ops
- Health (`/health`) and Prometheus metrics (`/metrics`)
- Structured JSON logs; request IDs

### Code quality
- Type hints, clear separation of concerns
- Ruff clean, mypy clean (CI)
- Async/await used consistently

### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions: Python 3.12/3.13 matrix, pip caching, least-privilege permissions, concurrency cancellation
- Pre-commit: Ruff (format + lint)

### Tests
- **53 passing**, **21 skipped** (documented)
- Core flows: auth, protected routes, health/metrics, adapters, tools basics

---

## ⚠️ Follow-ups (tracked as issues)

1) **RBAC enforcement across all protected routes**  
   Apply `AuthorizationManager` checks to adapter execute/fetch & tool endpoints; return 403 + AUTHZ audit.

2) **Audit coverage expansion**  
   Log `adapter.create`, `adapter.execute`, `tool.execute` success/failure; include request IDs in context.

3) **CacheManager integration**  
   L1 cache for REST adapter GETs (method+url+query+headers subset); add hit/miss metrics.

4) **Unskip lifespan-dependent tests**  
   Switch to `httpx.ASGITransport(lifespan="on")` fixtures; make hermetic where feasible.

5) **Docs refresh**  
   README auth & env vars; CI badges; ADR for audit/authz.

6) **Security & ops hardening**  
   Rotate non-default `JWT_SECRET` in CI/prod; enforce HTTPS; protect `main` with required CI checks.

---

## Current gaps / risks

- RBAC not enforced uniformly on every route
- Lifespan-dependent tests still skipped
- Caching not yet leveraged for adapters

---

## Configuration (production pointers)

- Ensure **`JWT_SECRET` is non-default** and managed via secrets
- TLS termination at ingress/proxy; HSTS already emitted by app
- Set `ENVIRONMENT=production`; restrict CORS appropriately
- Resource limits & liveness/readiness probes in your orchestrator

---

## Test posture

- Local & CI: `pytest -q` → 53 pass / 21 skipped  
- Skips are intentional (see `FASTMCP_LIFESPAN_ISSUE_REPORT.md`)  
- `ANYIO_BACKEND=asyncio` set in CI

---

## Deployment readiness checklist

- [x] CI green on matrix
- [x] Pre-commit enabled (Ruff)
- [x] Security headers & CORS
- [x] Audit logging in place
- [x] Auth working (JWT/local)
- [ ] RBAC enforced on all routes
- [ ] Cache for REST adapter GETs
- [ ] Lifespan tests re-enabled

---

## Conclusion

The project is **production-capable** today for controlled environments. With RBAC enforcement across all protected routes, expanded audit coverage, and optional caching, it reaches full production posture. Lifespan-dependent tests can be re-enabled without touching runtime code.
