## ⚠️ Areas Needing Attention

### 1. **Test Coverage Issues**
- **0% code coverage** - Tests are not actually exercising the application code
- **4 skipped tests** due to authentication issues
- **Missing integration tests** for critical paths
- **No load testing** or performance benchmarks

### 2. **Authentication Problems**
- **Multiple failed login attempts** in audit logs
- **Test authentication failures** causing skipped tests
- **Default credentials** (admin/admin123) should be changed in production

### 3. **Security Concerns**
- **No rate limiting** implemented
- **Missing input validation** in some areas
- **No security headers** (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- **API keys exposed** in environment variables

### 4. **Monitoring & Observability**
- **No metrics collection** (Prometheus, etc.)
- **Limited logging** beyond audit events
- **No alerting** for failures or security events
- **No distributed tracing**

### 5. **Performance & Scalability**
- **No caching strategy** beyond in-memory
- **No connection pooling** for database adapters
- **No horizontal scaling** configuration
- **No performance benchmarks**

## 🔧 Critical Fixes Required

### 1. **Fix Authentication System**
```python
# In app/settings.py - Change default credentials
ADMIN_USERNAME: str = "admin"  # Should be environment variable
ADMIN_PASSWORD: str = "admin123"  # Should be environment variable
```

### 2. **Implement Rate Limiting**
```python
# Add to requirements.txt
slowapi>=0.1.9

# Implement in main.py
from slowapi import Limiter, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler
from slowapi.util import get_remote_address
from slowapi.errors import RateLimitExceeded
```

### 3. **Add Security Headers**
```python
# Add to main.py
from starlette.middleware.security import SecurityMiddleware

app.add_middleware(SecurityMiddleware,
    headers={
        "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
        "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
        "X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block",
        "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
    }
)
```

### 4. **Improve Test Coverage**
- Add unit tests for all tool functions
- Add integration tests for authentication flow
- Add performance tests
- Add security tests (penetration testing)

### 5. **Add Monitoring**
```python
# Add to requirements.txt
prometheus-client>=0.19.0
structlog>=23.2.0
```
